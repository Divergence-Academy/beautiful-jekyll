*Are you a interested in taking a course with us? Learn more on our programs [page](http://divergence.academy/data-science-immersive) or [contact us](mailto:hello@divergence.academy).*

The course duration is from **Jan 16th - Mar 28th, 2017**.

This 12-week course is a right blend of Business Analysis, Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and Software Development to build a Data Product. This course is well suited for:
 
- **Developers** who want to transition to a new role of a Data Scientist
- **Entrepreneurs** who want to launch new products covering IoT and analytics
- **PhD students** who want to transition to the business world

## PREREQUISITES ##

If it’s been a long time since you used any linear algebra, this is a good time for a refresher. Here are the relevant concepts on Metacademy. Each one gives a number of pointers, but the Khan Academy links are especially useful since they have auto-graded exercises you can use to check your understanding.


- [vectors](http://www.metacademy.org/graphs/concepts/vectors)
- [dot product](http://www.metacademy.org/graphs/concepts/dot_product)
- [linear systems as matrices](http://www.metacademy.org/graphs/concepts/linear_systems_as_matrices)
- [matrix multiplication](http://www.metacademy.org/graphs/concepts/matrix_multiplication)
- [matrix inverse](http://www.metacademy.org/graphs/concepts/matrix_inverse)
[matrix transpose](http://www.metacademy.org/graphs/concepts/matrix_transpose)


If you haven’t taken a programming class, you may need to spend some time learning the basics. You should watch Lectures 2, 3, 4, and 6 of [MIT 6.001 on EdX](https://courses.edx.org/courses/MITx/6.00.1_4x/3T2014/courseware/Week_0/). (Lectures 7 and 11 are also helpful.)


If you have programming experience but not in Python, read [Learn X in Y Minutes](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/) for a concise summary of the language. You can probably pick up Python quickly if you are familiar with another general-purpose language (C, Java, Matlab, etc.).
Read [this tutorial](http://www.engr.ucsb.edu/~shell/che210d/numpy.pdf) on NumPy, the library we’ll use for array manipulation and linear algebra.

## ONLINE RESOURCES FOR GETTING STARTED WITH DATA SCIENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING 

For someone trying to get started with ML, here is a resource where the complexity is just right. It introduces you to a lot of the essential Mathematics, but doesn’t go too deep into it. It is an [equivalent of the Applied ML course at Stanford](https://class.coursera.org/ml-003/lecture/index).

Very briefly, here are the ML algorithms which are very useful and basic, and will help you solve a lot of problems.

- Regression- Single, Multiple Variables, Logistic Regression
- Overfitting and Underfitting issues- ‘Bias’ and ‘Variance’
- Simple clustering algorithms- K-Means
- Applying basic linear algebra: Principal Component Analysis
- Recommendation Systems and Large Scale Systems.
- Many people have gone on to become top Kaggle contestants (a popular data science contest portal) after doing this course. These introductory algorithms can be extremely useful.

Apart from this we’d also recommend learning a bit about text processing such as regular expressions, string functions and language models. You might find them in the first few lectures and tutorials on this [Natural Language Processing Course](https://www.coursera.org/course/nlp).


- We’d like to emphasize that a lot of the Mathematics involved doesn’t require much more than an introductory statistics code.
- For a quick and general introduction to Data Science, the course material from [this Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci) is great, and introduces R, Python, Map-Reduce and Data Visualization techniques.
- At a later stage, and for those looking for more academically challenging and abstract courses, you might be interested in the [Learning from Data](http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html) course from Caltech and the [Probabilistic Graphical Models course from Stanford](https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm). The first course gives more theoretical insights into the foundations of Machine Learning and Statistical Leaning Theory; the second is about mixing Data Structures with Statistics to evolve Bayesian Networks and Hidden Markov Models: powerful tools, which are used in medical diagnostics, speech recognition engines, Kinect – and have been found to be significant improvements on traditional Machine Learning techniques.

The difference in our course structure is that it has been more blended to suit the needs of customers in Midwest and Heartland states.*
